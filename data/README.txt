The data in this directory are used in the paper:
Lohmann et al (2025), "Cylarim: A novel Software for Spatially-Resolved Laminar fMRI Mapping".


The file "rim_M.v" is imported from https://github.com/layerfMRI/LAYNIIi/test_data/rim_M.nii.gz.
The file "metric_M.v" is generated using "rim_M.v" as input using the cylarim program "vmetric".
The file "zmap_M.v" is synthetically generated to simulate an activation map with a laminar-specific activation pattern.



The files "ana_vaso.v" and "zmap_vaso.v" are taken from the following publication:
Huber et al (2017), "High-Resolution CBV-fMRI Allows Mapping of Laminar Activity and Connectivity of Cortical Input and Output in Human M1", Neuron, Vol 96.

"zmap_vaso.v" corresponds to Fig 3A of this publication ("tapping with touch").
"ana_vaso.v" shows the underlying anatomy.
"rim_vaso.v" is adapted from the grey/white matter segmentation used in this paper.
"metric_vaso.v" was generated from "rim_vaso.v" using the program "vmetric".
